Wiring Instructions

1. Motors

Motor Driver L298N → Motors

IN1 → Arduino D5

IN2 → Arduino D4

IN3 → Arduino D8

IN4 → Arduino D12

ENA (left motors PWM) → Arduino D3

ENB (right motors PWM) → Arduino D11


Motor Power: Connect to battery (7.4V) via L298N motor driver

GND: Connect Arduino GND and battery GND to L298N GND

2. Radar Servo + Ultrasonic Sensor

Radar Servo Signal → Arduino D6

Radar Ultrasonic Trig → Arduino D9

Radar Ultrasonic Echo → Arduino D10

Radar VCC → 5V

Radar GND → GND



---

3. Lever Switch (Start/Stop)

One terminal → Arduino D2

Other terminal → GND

Use internal pull-up in code (INPUT_PULLUP)

Lever OFF → HIGH (bot stops), Lever ON → LOW (bot runs)

4. OLED Display (Optional)

SDA → Arduino A4

SCL → Arduino A5

VCC → 5V

GND → GND



---

5. Power

Arduino Vin / 5V powered from 2S Li-ion battery (through L298N 5V output or separate 5V regulator)

Motors powered via L298N motor driver 7.4V input

Common GND shared across Arduino, motors, and sensor

6. Notes

Make sure the radar servo has enough current (some small servos can run from Arduino 5V, but heavy ones may need separate 5V).

Processing visualization: Connect Arduino to PC via USB to get real-time radar data.

OLED display is optional; it only shows closest object / status, not the full radar sweep.
